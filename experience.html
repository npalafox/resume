      <h1>My previous work experience</h1>
      <p> Throughout my almost 2.5 years at Michigan I have been lucky enough to gain a lot of professional experience.
        I have had awesome internships and jobs within the school of information.

          <h2>Product Manager Intern at American Express (Kabbage)</h2>
          <p>
            I worked as a Product Manager for Kabbage, a startup that was recently acquired by American Express. I really
            enjoyed this internship because I was in a fast paced startup environment with the support of a huge company. 
            I was tasked with optimizing the company's current instance of Salesforce. The project consisted of three major 
            parts: interviewing the sales team, compiling all the data and identifying common issues, and brainstorming solutions.
            In addition to my project, I kickstarted a process to maintain and track system requests.

      <h2>Data Programming Instructional Aide</h2>
      <p>
        SI 206 is a data analytics class that 
        specifically works with Python, but also has some units in html and SQL. As an IA I have weekly office hours
        where I am responsible for assisting students with their homework. Additionally, I have a discussion section 
        every week where students work on a specific assignment. It is an excellent job because I get to help
        students and get to keep my python skills sharp!

      <h2>Product Owner Intern at Quicken Loans</h2>
      <p> 
        I was a Product Owner intern at Quicken Loans. Due to COVID-19, I was not able to work in the 
        office, so it was a remote internship. This summer was an amazing learning experience because it introduced me 
        to the more technical side of Product Management. I was able to become Product Owner/ Product Manager certified
        in the Scaled Agile Framework. Additionally, I was able to work on writing user stories in the team's backlog and
        led a hack week team full of interns. The hack week event was centered around designing a mobile app and I was
        lucky enough to be the lead Product Manager.
