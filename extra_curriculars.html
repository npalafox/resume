    <h1>My extra curricular activity at the University of Michigan.</h1>
    <p>I am involved in numerous clubs at Michigan. They can be split into two categories: hobbies and academic interests. 
      I really enjoy all the clubs I am in at Michigan and think they all prepare me to be successful and also bring me joy.
      My favorite hobby is soccer! I have been playing soccer since I was 8 years old and almost played for a few varsity programs.

        <h2>Academic Extra Curriculars</h2>
        <h3>MPRODUCT</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>MPRODUCT is the only Product Management club on campus. It is an amazing club that connects me with 
            other students interested in Product Management. I have learned a lot of about customer discovery in 
            this club and in order to be a member I had to go through a 3 week cohort process including multiple 
            tasks that typical Product Managers (PM) do. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Reach Consulting Group</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> I am currently a Project Manager in <a href="https://www.michiganrcg.com/" target=_blank>
            Reach Consulting Group</a>. Reach Consulting Group is a student-run, 
            non-profit organization providing advisory services in technology, strategy, finance, and management. 
            We are affiliated with the University of Michigan's School of Information and have a strong emphasis 
            on technology consulting. <br>

      <h2>Athletic Extra Curriculars</h2>
      <h3>Club Soccer (UMMCS)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://www.ummcs.org/" target=_blank> The University of Michigan Men's Club Soccer Team</a>  
            (UMMCS) is the second highlest level of 
            soccer at Michigan. We compete in the NIRSA conference where we have participated in the National
            Tournamnent every year I have been on the team. My Freshman year, we won a Regional Championship
            with the 3rd highest point total in the country. Even though it is club soccer it is a very competitive
            team that is consistently one of the best in the country.
        </li>
        <li> I am also the Director of Special Projects on UMMCS. This role has allowed me to learn new concepts
            such as Search Engine Optimization (SEO). It is an interesting role since there is so much ambiguity and
            I enjoy the suspense.
