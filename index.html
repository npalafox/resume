      <h2>My Academics <img src="images/logo.png" alt="logo" id = "logo"> </h2>
      <p> I am currently a junior at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Go blue! I grew up a Michigan State fan
        because my mom attended MSU, but I am a huge Michigan sports fan now. I am hoping to use my degree in Information 
        from the School of Information to secure a job in the product management field. I have a lot of experience in the 
        product field and I really enjoy the fast paced environment.
